✨**Features**
- 🟢 Airdrop claim
- 🟢 STO token transfer
- 🟢 Native(BnB) token transfer

🚀**Installation and launch**
1. git clone [https://github.com/ShrimpToWhale/StakeStone-CLaim-Transfer](https://github.com/ShrimpToWhale/StakeStone-CLaim-Transfer)
2. cd StakeStone-CLaim-Transfer
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python main.py

📁**Files that need to be filled out**
- `wallets.txt` - private keys of your EVM accounts (with or without '0x')
- `recipients.txt` - addresses where STO and BNB will be deposited
- `proxies.txt` - proxies in the login:password@host:port format
  
❗ **The number of proxies, private keys, and deposit addresses must be the same**

❗**If a proxy is not working, the software will automatically use the local IP to send requests.**

🛠️**Workflow and Configuration**

Upon launching the software, you’ll be prompted to set two types of delays(in seconds):
1. Delay between accounts – how long the script waits before switching to the next account
2. Delay between actions – pauses between claiming, STO and BNB transfering

You’ll also be asked whether you want to shuffle the wallets before execution (each private key keeps its original address and proxy pairing).

**The software executes claim, STO transfer, and BNB transfer sequentially.
If a wallet does not have enough funds or is not eligible for the airdrop, the subsequent operations will not be performed.**
